# GPT--4.5-Introducing GPT-4.5 on Azure OpenAI Service

## Introducing GPT-4.5 on Azure OpenAI Service: A New Era of AI

Azure OpenAI Service has just unveiled GPT-4.5, a groundbreaking model that builds upon its predecessors' success. This research preview showcases advancements in pre and post-training scaling, marking significant progress in unsupervised learning.

### Natural Interaction
GPT-4.5 excels in providing a more natural interaction experience. With a broader knowledge base and improved "EQ," it enhances coding, writing, and problem-solving tasks. 

### Accuracy and Hallucinations
Compared to GPT-4.0, GPT-4.5 boasts a lower hallucination rate (37.1% vs. 61.8%) and higher accuracy (62.5% vs. 38.2%). This means developers can rely on more precise and relevant responses, making it a more dependable tool.

### Stronger Human Alignment
Enhanced alignment techniques in GPT-4.5 improve its ability to follow instructions, understand nuances, and engage in natural conversations. This makes it an effective tool for coding and project management.

### Versatile Applications
Developers can leverage GPT-4.5 in numerous ways to enhance productivity and creativity:
- **Communication**: Craft clear and effective emails, messages, and documentation.
- **Personalized Learning and Coaching**: Acquire new skills or deepen knowledge in specific areas.
- **Brainstorming**: Generate innovative ideas and solutions.
- **Project Planning and Execution**: Organize tasks and ensure thorough, efficient approaches.
- **Task Automation**: Simplify intricate processes and workflows.
- **Coding Workflows**: Streamline coding with step-by-step guidance and automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors.

Enterprise customers can start exploring GPT-4.5's capabilities in Azure AI Foundry today.

### New Models: Phi-4, Stability AI, and Recent Releases
The latest wave of AI models focuses on delivering specialized capabilities with greater efficiency. These releases represent a shift toward purpose-built AI that excels in specific domains while requiring fewer computational resources. Here are some standout launches on Azure AI Foundry:

## Phi-4 Multimodal: Unifies text, speech, and vision for context-aware interactions. For instance, retail kiosks can now diagnose product issues via camera and voice inputs, eliminating the need for complex manual descriptions.

## Phi-4 Mini: Outperforms larger models on coding and math tasks while increasing inference speed by 30% compared to previous models.

### Sample Code
Here's a simple example of how you can use GPT-4.5 to generate code:

```python
import openai

# Initialize the OpenAI client
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Define the prompt
prompt = "Create a function in Python to reverse a string"

# Generate the response
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="gpt-4.5",
  prompt=prompt,
  max_tokens=100
)

# Print the generated code
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

This code initializes the OpenAI client, defines a prompt, and generates a response using GPT-4.5.
